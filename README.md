# Tic Tac Toe
An example Java refresher assignment in the [Software Engineering course](https://rkurniawati.github.io/sweng.html) that I teach. 

This assignment emphasizes the following concepts:
 - MVC architecture
 - Design patterns (singleton, factory, and observer)
 - Testing
    - Unit testing with JUnit 
    - Integration / GUI testing with FXTest
